  "summary": "The diff appears to address centering/framing primarily by introducing new CharacterDock wrapper elements and (per the index.css file summary) updating Character Dock styling (height/padding/centering/overflow). However, it also includes unrequested changes to the 3D rendering stack (error boundary/WebGL fallback) and adjustments to camera/model positioning, which go beyond the requested “UI frame/layout/styling” approach.",
  "missing_requirements": [],
  "hallucinated_features": [
    {
      "description": "Added WebGL support detection, new error boundary, and fallback UI for 3D rendering failures.",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest is narrowly scoped to centering/framing the Character Dock preview box and avoiding clipping; it does not request new reliability/error-handling UI or WebGL capability checks.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/components/character/ArmoredHero3DCanvas.tsx"
      ]
    },
    {
      "description": "Adjusted 3D camera configuration (position/fov) in the character canvas.",
      "reason": "REQ-1 explicitly prefers solving the clipping/centering via UI frame/layout/styling rather than changing character/model transforms as the primary approach; camera changes are part of the 3D transform/view configuration rather than the UI frame.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/components/character/ArmoredHero3DCanvas.tsx"
      ]
    },
    {
      "description": "Changed model/group positioning (e.g., group positioned at [0, -0.8, 0]) while also procedurally updating transforms during animations.",
      "reason": "The request calls for fixing clipping/centering by adjusting the UI frame/layout/styling, not by changing the character/model transforms as the primary approach. The diff includes model transform adjustments that are outside the requested UI-only focus.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/components/character/TripoCharacterModel.tsx"
      ]
    },
    {
      "description": "Introduced new CharacterDock canvas wrapper structure (added `character-dock-canvas-inner`) and status text with emoji labels.",
      "reason": "Only the framing/alignment of the preview box/canvas container was requested; adding new inner wrapper layers and altering/introducing status messaging is not explicitly requested. (Wrapper might support styling, but the status text change is unrelated to framing.)",
