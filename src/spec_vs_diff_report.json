  "summary": "Diff adds an in-app reminder toast system with shared reminder-event context, a ringtone playback flow with autoplay fallback UI, and a 3D armored robot rendered via react-three-fiber whose animation is driven by active tab and reminder state. Some BuildRequest requirements are not fully evidenced, notably always-visible character placement, graceful 3D fallback handling, and the non-blue/purple-dominant theme constraint.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-3",
      "requirement": "3D armored-hero/robot character is visible during normal app usage (not only in reminder toast).",

      "requirement": "If WebGL/3D rendering fails, the UI degrades gracefully (e.g., placeholder) without crashing.",
      "reason": "No error boundary, try/catch, or explicit fallback/placeholder behavior is shown for the 3D Canvas; the ArmoredHero3DCanvas file is truncated and the diff summary does not evidence graceful degradation.",

      "requirement": "Apply a cohesive theme avoiding a blue/purple-dominant palette.",
      "reason": "Global theme variables set `--primary` to OKLCH hue 264 in both light and dark modes (blue/purple region), and the 3D character visor material uses a bright blue color (`#3498db`), suggesting the new UI may still be blue/purple-dominant.",
