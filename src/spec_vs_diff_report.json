  "summary": "Diff updates the Upload tab empty-state to use a new PATENTED round logo path and adds a combined flip+continuous-rotation Tailwind animation with reduced-motion support. However, the required static asset file was not added (no added files), and there are unrelated/contra-request changes (notably AppHeader branding/layout and other behavior changes). Evidence is insufficient to confirm the requested PDF/in-app text-overlap fixes.",
